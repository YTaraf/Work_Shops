# Data Science Visualization Workshop

## Overview

Welcome to the **Data Science Visualization Workshop**! This workshop is designed for beginners who are looking to get hands-on experience with data visualization using Python. In this workshop, participants will explore the fundamentals of data visualization, understand different types of graphs, and learn how to implement them using **Matplotlib** and other popular Python libraries.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to create clear, informative, and visually engaging data visualizations to better analyze and present data.

## All Work to be Conducted in Google Colab

All work related to this project will be carried out in **[Google Colab](https://colab.google/)**. Google Colab is a free, cloud-based platform that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks with access to GPUs and other powerful tools.

To get started, simply follow these steps:
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).
2. Create a new notebook and get coding.
   
## Inputting the CSV File into Google Colab

To load the Titanic dataset into Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the CSV file**:
   - In your Colab notebook, use the following code to upload your CSV file:
     ```python
     from google.colab import files
     uploaded = files.upload()
     ```
   - This will prompt you to choose a file from your local machine. Select the Titanic dataset `.csv` file.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (recommended for running the workshop code)

You can install the necessary libraries with the following commands:
```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas jupyter
