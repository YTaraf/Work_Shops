# Linear Regression Workshop: Exploring Housing Prices

Welcome to the **Linear Regression Workshop**! In this session, we will explore **simple and multiple linear regression models** using Python, focusing on using **graphs to check the assumptions** of regression.  

The workshop uses the dataset: `Housing_Prices17.csv`.

## Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. Fit **simple and multiple linear regression models** using Python.
2. Visualize relationships between variables.
3. Check the **four main assumptions of linear regression** using graphical methods:
   - **Linearity**: Relationship between predictors and response is linear.
   - **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals.
   - **Normality of residuals**: Residuals are approximately normally distributed.
   - **Independence**: Residuals are independent of each other.
4. Interpret model results and residual diagnostics.

## Dataset

- **File**: `Housing_Prices17.csv`
- **Description**: Contains housing data such as prices, living area, number of bedrooms, and other features for homes in 2017.
- **Columns** (examples):
  - `Price`: Sale price of the house.
  - `Living Area`: Size of the house in square feet.
  - `Bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
  - `Bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms.
  - Additional relevant features for modeling.
