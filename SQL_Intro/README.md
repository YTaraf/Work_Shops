# Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL) Workshop

## Overview

Welcome to the **Introduction to SQL Workshop**! This beginner-friendly session is designed to teach participants the fundamentals of **Relational Databases** and **Structured Query Language (SQL)**. 

Throughout the workshop, participants will explore key concepts such as database structure, Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling, schemas, and how to interact with databases using SQL. We will focus on the **PostgreSQL** flavor of SQL, one of the most powerful and widely-used relational database systems.

By the end of this workshop, you will:
- Understand the core principles of relational databases.
- Be able to interpret and analyze Database design schemas.
- Write and execute basic SQL queries.
- Appreciate the role of databases in real-world applications.

## Hands-On Practice

All practical work will be done using [**DB Fiddle**](https://www.db-fiddle.com/), an online SQL editor that supports PostgreSQL.

### Setting Up

To begin:

1. On the top left of the [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) site, change the SQL flavor from **MySQL** to the most recent version of **PostgreSQL**.
2. Copy the **database schema** from the GitHub repository:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [HR_Database.sql](https://github.com/YTaraf/Work_Shops/blob/main/SQL_Intro/HR_Database.sql)  
   Paste it into the "Schema SQL" section on the left-hand side of DB Fiddle.
3. Run and save the schema code.
4. Copy the **sample data/values** from the GitHub repository:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [HR_Data_Values.sql](https://github.com/YTaraf/Work_Shops/blob/main/SQL_Intro/HR_Data_Values.sql)  
   Insert the values *below* the schema code to populate your tables â€” make sure none of the schema code is lost.
5. Run and save the data/value code.
