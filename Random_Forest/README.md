# Random Forest Classification Workshop

Welcome to the **Random Forest Workshop**! In this session, we will explore how Random Forests classify data using Python, with a hands-on approach to training models, evaluating performance, and understanding feature importance.

The workshop uses the **Iris dataset**.

---

## Workshop Objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Train a Random Forest classifier using Python.  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
- Visualize feature importance to understand which variables influence predictions.  
- Experiment with model parameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `max_features` to see their effect on accuracy.

## Dataset
**Dataset:** Iris (built into `scikit-learn`)  
**Description:** A small dataset containing measurements of iris flowers with the species label.  

**Columns:**  
- `sepal length (cm)`  
- `sepal width (cm)`  
- `petal length (cm)`  
- `petal width (cm)`  
- `target`: Species of the iris (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`)
