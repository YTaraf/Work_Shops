# Logistic Regression Workshop

## Overview
Welcome to the **Logistic Regression Workshop**!  
This workshop is designed for beginners who want **hands-on experience** using **Logistic Regression** with Python.

By the end of this workshop, attendees will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of Logistic Regression.
- Build predictive models using real-world datasets.
- Create clear, informative, and visually engaging data visualizations.
- Analyze and present data more effectively.

## Workshop Structure
1. **Introduction to Logistic Regression**  
   - Learn the mathematics behind logistic regression.
   - Understand real-world use cases where logistic regression is applied.
2. **Creating a Basic Logistic Regression Model in Python**  
   - Step-by-step guide to building a logistic regression model.
3. **Building a Cancer Prediction Model**  
   - Hands-on project: Predicting cancer diagnoses (Benign vs Malignant) using logistic regression.
   - Working with a real-world cancer dataset.

## Project Environment: Google Colab

All work will be conducted on **Google Colab**, a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment.

**To get started:**
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Start coding!

## Dataset

We will use the **Cancer.csv** dataset provided at:  
[https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Cancer.csv](https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Cancer.csv)

To load the dataset in Colab:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset directly from the URL
url = 'https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Cancer.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows
data.head()
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**

Youâ€™ll need to install/import the following Python libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from sklearn.metrics import (
    accuracy_score, 
    precision_score, 
    recall_score, 
    confusion_matrix, 
    classification_report, 
    f1_score
)
```

You can install the necessary libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

> **Note:** If you are using **Google Colab**, all these libraries are already pre-installed. You can skip the installation step!
