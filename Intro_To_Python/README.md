#  Intro to Python Workshop

Welcome to the **Intro to Python Workshop**!  
In this workshop, you'll learn the fundamentals of Python programming — from basic data types to more advanced structures — and write your own Python code **directly in your browser** using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  

---

##  Topics Covered

1. **Basic Data Types**
   - Integers (`int`)
   - Floating-point numbers (`float`)
   - Strings (`str`)
   - Booleans (`bool`)

2. **Print Statements**
   - Using `print()` to display text and values
   - String concatenation

3. **Input Statements**
   - Using `input()` to capture user data

4. **Arithmetic**
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
   - Modulus (`%`), exponentiation (`**`), floor division (`//`)

5. **Comparison Operators**
   - `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

6. **Loops**
   - `for` loops
   - `while` loops

7. **Control Conditions**
   - `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
   - Nesting conditions
   - Combining conditions with `and` / `or` / `not`

8. **Advanced Data Types**
   - Lists (`list`)
   - Tuples (`tuple`)
   - Sets (`set`)

##  Workshop Format

- **Live Coding in Google Colab** — No installation required, just a web browser.
- **Hands-On Exercises** after each topic.

---

##  Getting Started with Google Colab

1. Open **Google Colab**: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **File → New Notebook** to create a Python environment.
4. Type Python code into the code cells and press **Shift + Enter** to run.

---

##  Requirements

- A Google account.
- Internet access.
- Basic familiarity with using a web browser.

---

##  Running Python Code in Colab

- Each code cell can be run independently.
- You can add new cells with **+ Code**.
- Use **Markdown cells** for notes and explanations.
- All code runs on Google’s cloud — no need to install Python locally.

---

##  After the Workshop

By the end of this workshop, you will:
- Understand Python’s syntax and data types.
- Be able to write interactive programs.
- Have a strong foundation for exploring future advanced topics like functions, libraries, and data analysis.
